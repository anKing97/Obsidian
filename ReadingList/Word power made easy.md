This session is very fun, first, again a Latin word *verto:*  means to turn. Like the word :
when your thoughs are constantly turn inward: *introvert ;*    when your thoughts turn outward: *extrovert;*   and when you are in both: *ambivert.* 

this is another Latin word : *ambi-*   means both. like *ambidextrous:* means  able to use both hands with skill.  and the word :  d*exterous:* means skillful.  and the *dexter* means right hand. because we often use the right hand, so it is useful and skillful. 

furthor more:  the author tell us something about the left-hand,  in the Latin,  the word for the left-hand is *sinister.*  so the same word  *sinister* means dangerous, a stereotype.

And the French word for the left-hand is *gauche .*  so the word *gauche* in the English mean clumsiness, especially in the social. 

But the French word for the right hand is *droit* . there is another word *adroit:* still means skillful.
